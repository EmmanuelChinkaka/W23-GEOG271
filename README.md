# Welcome to GEOG271 – Introduction to Geographic Data Analysis

This course provides an introduction to computational, statistical, and graphical techniques used in scientific data
analysis with particular emphasis on the special nature of geographic data using python. We cover a range of topics
needed for basic geographic and environmental data analysis, especially as it leads to mapping. We Introduce python
programming for GIS Data using Geopandas and spatial analysis using Google Collab platform. This course introduces
various techniques for the analysis of spatial data and will be comprised of lectures and practical assignments and a
final project for the final exam. On the practical side, students will conduct spatial analysis with GIS software including
ArcGIS Pro and Python scripting, and model builder.
