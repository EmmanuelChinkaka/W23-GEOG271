And put in your username
- Create a repository called FDSfE\_\<FirstinitialLastname\>;
my first initial is E, my last name is Chinkaka, so mine would be W23GEOG\_FChinkaka

- Add a README file when you create your repository that indicates that this is the repo for Foundations of Data Science.  When the repository gets created the README is empty. You should edit it to reflect the purpose of the repository. Use the pencil symbol on the right of the readme in the repository main page to edit it
